The Claim: A Cup of Coffee can Ease the Symptoms of Asthma
THE FACTS Caffeine is known more as a pick-me-up than a home remedy, but for years scientists have wondered whether it may have benefits for people with asthma. The suspicion stems in part from its chemical structure, which resembles that of theophylline, a common asthma medication that relaxes the airway muscles and relieves wheezing, shortness of breath and other respiratory problems.

The hidden dangers of caffeine: How coffee causes exhaustion, fatigue and addiction
Most a.m. coffee drinkers don't realize it, but their morning cups of coffee set their bodies up for a rollercoaster day of highs and lows, only to bottom out at the point of exhaustion. Just a few hours after consumption, when the artificial high dies down, many people may reach for more coffee or something sugary to get another lift, leading to daily fluctuations in energy and alertness, and possibly to eventual chronic adrenal exhaustion.

Coffee drinkers usually start out with one or two cups a day, but over time it isn't unusual for the habit to increase to between five and 10 or more cups daily. The morning coffee becomes more than a ritual: it's a "caffeine fix" needed by the body to rebalance the blood that is out of balance because of the previous day's caffeine intake. The major addictive substance in coffee is caffeine, a white crystalline alkaloid that stimulates the brain and artificially and chemically lessens fatigue.

Melatonin for the prevention and treatment of jet lag.
BACKGROUND: Jet-lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day-night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re-align them with the outside world. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet-lag after air travel across several time zones.

Using Melatonin to Eliminate Jet Lag
Jet lag is a common frustration for many travelers. We experience jet lag because our body's natural rhythm has been thrown off by traveling through many time zones in a very short period. There are many symptoms one may experience with jet lag, but the most difficult obstacle associated with air travel is the inability to fall asleep in the new time zone. We are unable to fall asleep because our body is used to producing melatonin at our old bed time, not our new one. This will correct on it's little by little everyday, but we can assist our bodily rhythms and ensure a full nights sleep by supplementing with melatonin.

Can Melatonin Help Against Jet Lag
Melatonin is a hormone that derives from the neurotransmitter serotonin and is produced by the pineal gland, a small gland in the center of the brain. Biologists don't know exactly how melatonin works, except that it's a very important timekeeper of circadian rhythms, which regulate hormone secretion. The body secretes certain hormones at certain times of the day, and melatonin seems to regulate this. As such, melatonin controls periods of sleepiness and wakefulness. Melatonin production is stimulated by periods of darkness and suppressed by periods of light.

Melatonin is a popular supplement for the sleep-deprived, namely because it carries rather innocent associations. Melatonin is "natural" and "safe" and "herbal", right? Wrong. I've been arguing with the melatonin prophets for years because I believe the image melatonin has, and what melatonin really is, are vastly different. Like so many things that we trust in, consume or think we understand, the truth may not be what we want to believe. My caution with melatonin is simple: melatonin is a hormone.

Bariatric Surgery for Severe Obesity
Severe obesity is a chronic condition that is hard to treat with diet and exercise alone. Bariatric surgery is an operation on the stomach and/or intestines that helps patients with extreme obesity to lose weight. This surgery is an option for people who cannot lose weight by other means or who suffer from serious health problems related to obesity. The surgery restricts food intake, which promotes weight loss and reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Some surgeries also interrupt how food is digested, preventing some calories and nutrients, such as vitamins, from being absorbed. Recent studies suggest that bariatric surgery may even lower death rates for patients with severe obesity. The best results occur when patients follow surgery with healthy eating patterns and regular exercise.

Do sealants prevent dental decay in the permanent teeth?
Correct
http://www.neeshdental.com/procedures/pediatric-dentistry/sealing-out-tooth-decay/
Sealing Out Tooth Decay
Tooth decay has become increasingly prevalent in preschoolers. Not only is tooth decay unpleasant and painful, it can also lead to more serious problems like premature tooth loss and childhood periodontal disease. Dental sealants are an important tool in preventing childhood caries (cavities) and tooth decay. Especially when used in combination with other preventative measures, like biannual checkups and an excellent daily home care routine, sealants can bolster the mouth's natural defenses, and keep smiles healthy.
http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/s/sealants
Sealants
Dental sealants act as a barrier to prevent cavities. They are a plastic material usually applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth (premolars and molars) where decay occurs most often. Thorough brushing and flossing help remove food particles and plaque from smooth surfaces of teeth. But toothbrush bristles cannot reach all the way into the depressions and grooves to extract food and plaque. Sealants protect these vulnerable areas by "sealing out" plaque and food.
http://www.mchoralhealth.org/PDFs/OHDentSealantFactsheet.pdf
Preventing Tooth Deacay and Saving Teeth with Dental Sealants
Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings that are applied to the pits and fissures (grooves) on the chewing surfaces of molar teeth. Most tooth decay experienced by children and adolescents occurs on these surfaces. Sealants prevent dental caries (tooth decay) by creating a physical barrier against bacterial plaque and food.
https://www.cdhp.org/resources/314-dental-sealants-proven-to-prevent-tooth-decay
Dental Sealants: Proven to Prevent Tooth Decay
Dental sealants are protective coatings that are applied to children's most cavity-prone teeth and have been shown to reduce tooth decay by up to 60 percent. And the average cost of applying a sealant is less than one-third the cost of filling a cavity. Yet providing sealants to children who are most at risk of decay is no simple task. This May 2014 report by the Children's Dental Health Project (CDHP) examines the challenges that states face as they implement School Sealant Programs (SSPs).
http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/sealants
Tooth Sealants
Sealants are a thin coating painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth -- usually the back teeth (the premolars and molars) -- to prevent tooth decay. The painted on liquid sealant quickly bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth, forming a protective shield over the enamel of each tooth. Why Get Sealants? Although thorough brushing and flossing can remove food particles and plaque from smooth surfaces of teeth, they cannot always get into all the nooks and crannies of the back teeth to remove the food and plaque.

What are dental sealants? Sealants are thin, plastic coatings painted on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. Sealants are put on in dentists' offices, clinics, and sometimes in schools. Getting sealants put on is simple and painless. Sealants are painted on as a liquid and quickly harden to form a shield over the tooth.

What Is a Sealant?
A dental sealant is a thin plastic film painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth to prevent cavities. How effective are sealants? Studies have proven that properly applied sealants are 100-percent effective in protecting the tooth surfaces from cavities. As long as the sealant remains intact, small food particles and bacteria that cause cavities cannot penetrate through or around a sealant. Sealant protection is reduced or lost when part or all of the bond between the tooth and sealant is broken.

Simple Steps to Better Dental Health
A sealant is a clear or tinted plastic protective coating for teeth. It is painted onto the chewing surfaces of the back teeth (molars and premolars). These are the areas where most cavities form. Molars and premolars have grooves and crevices. Dentists call these pits and fissures. Food can get stuck in these crevices. Some are so deep that the bristles of a toothbrush can't reach into them. Grooves and crevices provide the perfect environment for bacteria to grow and cause cavities. Sealants help to prevent this from happening. They cover the grooves and crevices so that food cannot get into them.

Tooth Sealants - a) What are they? A dental sealant is a thin plastic coating (clear or white) that's bonded into the pits and grooves of a tooth. They're most frequently placed on the chewing surface of teeth (where most of a tooth's grooves lie). But they can also extend onto their cheek or tongue sides too (either as a continuous or separate piece) depending on what additional pits and fissures are found there

BPA in dental sealants: What parents need to know
Bisphenol A, better known as BPA, is a controversial substance that some experts think is harmless, while others believe it's causing all sorts of problems in kids, from ADHD to early onset puberty. If you're a parent, you probably know that BPA is found in some hard plastic bottles and the linings of canned food but did you know that it's also often in dental sealants? A new study says you probably don't need to worry about your kids getting sealants but pregnant women should steer clear.

Dental Sealants
Dental Sealants are a plastic or synthetic coating placed on your tooth surface which are designed to "prevent dental decay." Are they safe or effective? The claim is that, "Sealants can provide 100% protection from dental decay or "cavities" on the chewing surface." If this were true, then everybody could just get a dental sealant and nobody would have cavities.

Health Risks from Dental Sealants
It's funny what gets passed off as "preventive dentistry" for kids. Brushing, flossing, good nutrition and healthy lifestyle habits seem to be considered much too hard to instill in children. So instead, dentists turn to things like fluoride treatments, even though fluoride is a known neurotoxin, and sealants, even though they contain BPA and other toxic materials. A sealant is basically a protective covering on the teeth. It's made of a resin material, similar to composite (the stuff used to make "white" fillings), which is placed directly on the molars and allowed to seep into the crevices.

Dangers of Dental Tooth Sealant
Dental sealants are a thin layer of plastic varnish applied to the molars to reduce the possibility of cavities. Dental sealants are typically applied once a child loses his baby teeth, but there are some risks with dental sealants. Have a question? Get an answer from a doctor now! Features According to Dr. Frederick S. vom Saal, the plastic used in dental sealants contains bisphenol-A (BPA), a known endocrine disruptor. In addition to BPA, dental sealants also contain ethyltoulene sufonamide, a known toxin.

The Dangers of Dental Sealants
I just read an article saying that dental sealants are dangerous. This was an eye opener considering I just had sealants put on my sons 6 year molars. After reading the article I called the dentist and asked if they can be removed and told them why. Of course, I was told that they never heard of this. They are supposed to call me back to let me know if they can remove them. Sealants contain BPA. The same chemical that was once in baby bottles and was removed. Recent studies have further detailed the health impact of this substance, reported on at News Inferno:

Mercury fillings, dental sealants, and root canals may be linked to health problems. Here's what you need to know to stay safe. When you visit the dentist, you're probably hoping that you'll get a clean bill of dental health. Keep in mind, though, that you should also be looking closely at the health of your dentist's office. Many dental procedures that have been used for years—from fluoride applications to amalgam fillings to root canals—are now under scrutiny for their possible role in causing health problems. Learning about the issues surrounding these procedures can make you a more informed and safer dental patient.

Treating Alcohol Withdrawal With Benzodiazepines—Safe if Mindful
Alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous, but less so if properly managed. Alcohol withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant (see herefor an overview). Symptoms vary from person to person, but most people will experience some negative symptoms of alcohol withdrawal if they try to stop drinking after long term use. Mild to moderate symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, rapid heart rate, abnormal movements, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.
http://alcoholism.about.com/od/withdraw/a/blucd040604.htm
Specific Medical Treatment for Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms
Treatment Depends on the Severity of Symptoms The immediate goal of treatment is to calm the patient as quickly as possible. About 95 percent of people have mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, trembling, disturbed sleep, and lack of appetite. In 15 percent to 20 percent of people with moderate symptoms, brief seizures and hallucinations may occur, but they do not progress to full-blown delirium tremens.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_detoxification
Alcohol detoxification
Alcohol detoxification, or detox, for individuals with alcohol dependence, is the abrupt cessation of alcohol intake, a process often coupled with substitution of cross-tolerant drugs that have effects similar to the effects of alcohol in order to prevent alcohol withdrawal. As such, the term "detoxification" may be somewhat of a misnomer since the process need not refer exclusively to the removal of toxic substances from the body. Detoxification may or may not be indicated depending upon an individual's age, medical status, and history of alcohol intake.

Medications for management of alcohol withdrawal
Benzodiazepines are considered the treatment of choice for the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines reduce the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and the incidence of delirium and seizures. Based on indirect comparisons there is currently no strong evidence that particular benzodiazepines are more effective than others and selection should be made on an individual basis.1-2 Alprazolam and triazolam are not recommended. Diazepam (Valium®) is recommended due to its efficacy profile, wide therapeutic window and ‘self-tapering' effect due to its long half life.

Management of Withdrawal Syndromes and Relapse Prevention in Drug and Alcohol Dependence
The primary care physician is in a good position to diagnose, manage and intervene with patients who are undergoing the process of treatment and recovery from alcohol and drug disorders. Medications such as benzodiazepines are effective in the treatment of withdrawal syndromes, and naltrexone and disulfiram can be used to augment relapse prevention. Patients may also participate in psychosocial methods of addiction treatment that can reduce the risk of relapse and improve their psychosocial, health, legal and employment status.

Benzodiazepine treatment for alcohol-dependent patients.
Abstract Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are the preferred pharmacological agents for treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. Treatment with BZDs can be administered on an out-patient basis for subjects experiencing mild to moderate withdrawal and on an in-patient basis for the most severe forms of withdrawal. The efficacy of BZDs for long-term treatment of alcoholism has been more controversial. Controlled studies indicate that BZD treatment does not improve abstinence rate. Most reviews of drug treatment of alcoholism conclude that routine use of BZDs is not indicated on a long-term basis.

Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal
Plain language summary Benzodiazepines are more effective than placebo against alcohol withdrawal seizures while they have variable profile against other commonly used treatments This Cochrane review summarizes evidence from sixty‐four randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The available data show that benzodiazepines are effective against alcohol withdrawal seizures when compared to placebo and a potentially protective benefit for many outcomes when compared with other drugs. Data on safety outcomes are sparse and fragmented.

Benzodiazepine Side Effects
This is a list of side effects that may result from the use of benzodiazepines: So-called "Paradoxical" Effects. According to Professor Malcolm Lader, 5% of those using benzodiazepines may be affected by so-called "paradoxical" reactions in response to the drugs rather than the desired tranquillising effects. Such reactions include increased aggressiveness (in some individuals even violent behaviour), depression (with or without suicidal thoughts or intentions), and sometimes personality changes. In some instances, reactions such as hallucinations, depersonalisation, derealisation and other psychiatric symptoms occur.

MIXING ALCOHOL AND BENZOS
Benzodiazepines, or "benzos", are a family of sedatives or minor tranquilizers that are designed to treat insomnia, sleep deprivation, and anxiety. When these drugs are mixed with alcohol, they can intensely magnify alcohol's depressive effects and place users in serious physical and emotional jeopardy. Mixing alcohol and benzos can impair judgment, significantly decrease mobility or control over one's own movements, and dramatically depress the central nervous system. This combined abuse can also place intense strain on the respiratory system and significantly impair breathing. One of the largest issues with prescribing benzodiazepines for legitimate illness is determining a patient's level and frequency of alcohol consumption.
http://www.foundationsrecoverynetwork.com/dangers-mixing-alcohol-benzodiazepines/
Dangers of Mixing Alcohol and Benzodiazepines
Many people drink alcohol while taking other substances to enhance the effects of both drugs, but this activity is extremely dangerous. Mixing alcohol with benzodiazepines is especially risky, and can cause severe and permanent damage, both to a person's body and to her relationships. Seek professional help to quit whatever drug you abuse.

What are the Effects of Mixing Benzodiazepine and Alcohol?
Benzodiazepines are a class of prescription drugs frequently used to treat anxiety-related conditions. According to the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland, these drugs work by slowing the activity of neurons in the brain. The effects of mixing benzodiazepine and alcohol are profound and dangerous, and dependency on benzodiazepines is a real possibility when not taken in accordance with a doctor's instructions. If you or a loved one is suffering from a debilitating addiction, there is help.

Benzodiazepine Addiction Statistics
Benzodiazepine addiction is a very dangerous and difficult addiction to spring back from. Detox from benzodiazepine addiction can be life threatening. Benzodiazepines include such drugs as Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, Librium, Ativan, and Halcion. If the drugs are mixed with other substances they can really become lethal. It is never acceptable or safe to attempt coming off of benzodiazepines without professional medical supervision.

The Hidden Dangers of Benzodiazepines
In the last year there have been several studies/stories about the risks associated with benzodiazepine abuse. And while benzodiazepines have been prescribed for decades to treat anxiety and seizure disorders, the possible threat of overusing them is real and with that comes dependency, overdose and the potentiality of death. Did you know that since 2010, there have been 6,507 US drug overdose deaths that involved benzodizepines? Because of this rising number, FRN created an infographic to help familiarize those about benzodiazepines but most importantly help create awareness regarding the possible addiction with benzodiazepines.

Abstract: Background Low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health problem in Western industrialised countries and has been reported to affect up to 80% of adults at some stage in their lives. It is associated with high health care utilisation costs, disability, work loss and restriction of social activities. An intervention of foot orthoses or insoles has been suggested to reduce the risk of developing LBP and be an effective treatment strategy for people suffering from LBP.

MELBOURNE, Australia—Oral ingestion of probiotics does not help relieve symptoms of eczema in children, according to a new Cochrane Library review. A research team coordinated out of the Royal Children's Hospital, Australia, reviewed controlled trials of live orally ingested microorganisms for the treatment of eczema, including a total of 12 studies with 781 patients. There was no significant difference in patient or parent-rated scores in favor of probiotic treatment nor in symptom severity. The researchers noted there was significant heterogeneity between results of studies, possibly due to the use of different probiotic strains. Robert John Boyle, lead author, said:

Abstract - In vitro and in vivo animal studies have reported strong insulin-like or insulin-potentiating effects after cinnamon administration. Recently, a human intervention study showed that cinnamon supplementation (1 g/d) strongly reduced fasting blood glucose concentration (30%) and improved the blood lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Effect of Cinnamon on Glucose and Lipid Levels in Non–Insulin-Dependent Type 2 Diabetes
Interest in cinnamon as a potentially useful treatment for type 2 diabetes began with the discovery almost 20 years ago of cinnamon's insulin-sensitizing properties (1). Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated cinnamon's effect on insulin signal transduction (2–6). A study in diabetic mice showed that cinnamon lowered blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels while raising HDL cholesterol levels (7).

So this diet cannot work unless you reduce your food intake to compensate for the excess sugar you are consuming.

Cinnamon and Blood Sugar - Common Names: Cinnamomum verum, zeylanicum, Dalchina Chakka, kayu manis and cassia vera. The leaves are ovate-oblong in shape, 7–18 cm (2.75–7.1 inches) long. The flowers, which are arranged in panicles, have a greenish color, and have a distinct odor. The fruit is a purple one-centimeter berry containing a single seed. Its flavor is due to an aromatic essential oil that makes up 0.5% to 1% of its composition. This oil is prepared by roughly pounding the bark, macerating it in seawater, and then quickly distilling the whole. It is of a golden-yellow color, with the characteristic odor of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste.

For many years, researchers believed that the ability of cranberries and cranberry juice to help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) was partly related to the strong acidity of the cranberries. Recent research has shown that it's not the acidity of the cranberries, but the unusual nature of their proanthocyanidins (PACs) that is related to prevention of UTIs. The special structure of these PACs (involving A-type linkages between their components) acts as a barrier to bacteria that might otherwise latch on to the urinary tract lining.

Why Does Cranberry Juice Help With UTIs?
Definitions - A UTI, or urinary tract infection, is a bacterial infection affecting any part of the urinary tract. This is caused by bacteria getting into the bladder and multiplying within the urine. An effective treatment of a UTI is one that attacks the bacteria and stops it from multiplying. Double-blind tests in the 1990s (see References) that showed the effectiveness of cranberry juice against UTIs had better results with nearly pure cranberry juice, not cranberry juice cocktail, which is primarily made of sugar.

Cranberry Juice Does Help Prevent Urinary Infections in Women
Regular drinking of cranberry juice seems to reduce the recurrence of urinary tract infections in women. This is the conclusion of a study published in the British Medical Journal (June 29, 2001). One hundred and fifty women with a urinary tract infection were randomly allocated into three groups. The first group received 50 ml (a little over 3 tablespoons) of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for six months. The second group got 100 ml (just under 7 tablespoons) of lactobacillus drink five days a week for one year, and the third group received nothing and served as the control group.
